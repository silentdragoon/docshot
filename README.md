It's docshot!

To run [this .ahk file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/silentdragoon/docshot/main/docshot.ahk), you'll need [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/download/).

By default, pressing F12 will take a pair of screenshots (HDR and SDR) using Windows Game Bar, copy the SDR one to the clipboard for postin' on Twitter and copy both of them to a directory of the user's choice (currently I:/). 

To change these hotkey and/or save directory, just change the script. If you want to avoid overwriting keys that might be used elsewhere (e.g. F12), then you could make the trigger a higher F-key (e.g. F13), as long as you have the option to bind this in your keyboard / controller / mouse software of choice. Alternatively, choose a little-used key with some modifiers - Ctrl + Shift + Scroll Lock should be pretty safe (that's written as ^!{ScrollLock} btw).

*If you have any issues or feature requests, please let me know - I'm only a Twitter DM away. Have fun!*
