It's DocShot!

By default, pressing F12 will take a pair of screenshots (HDR and SDR) using Windows Game Bar, copy the SDR one to the clipboard for postin' on Twitter and copy both of them to a directory of the user's choice (currently I:/). 

*** If you have any issues or feature requests, please let me know - I'm only a Twitter DM away. Have fun! ***
